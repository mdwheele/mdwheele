## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dustin and I'm a software developer. You can find me on [Twitter](https://x.com/mdwheele) (I refuse to call it 'X'), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdwheele), and sometimes I do educational coding streams on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mdwheele).

## ðŸ’ª Coaching

I love working with up-and-coming developers who are looking to sharpen their skill-set or have been trying to break into the field. Please feel free to reach out and we can arrange a call over Zoom or Discord to chat about what's got you stumped at the moment!
